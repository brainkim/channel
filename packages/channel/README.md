# @channel/channel
The missing constructor for creating safe async iterators

## API

```ts
class Channel<T> implements AsyncIterableIterator<T> {
  constructor(executor: ChannelExecutor<T>, buffer?: ChannelBuffer<T>);
  next(value?: any): Promise<IteratorResult<T>>;
  return(value?: any): Promise<IteratorResult<T>>;
  throw(error: any): Promise<IteratorResult<T>>;
  [Symbol.asyncIterator](): this;
}
```

The `Channel` class implements the `AsyncIterableIterator` interface. Channels are designed to be indistinguishable from async generator objects.

```ts
type Push<T> = (value: PromiseLike<T> | T) => Promise<any | void>;

interface Stop extends Promise<any | void> {
  (error?: any): void;
}

type ChannelExecutor<T> = (
  push: Push<T>,
  stop: Stop
) => Promise<T | void> | T | void;
```

The `ChannelExecutor` is passed the arguments `push` and `stop`.

`push` is a function which allows you to enqueue values onto the channel. It synchronously throws an error if there are too many pending pushes on the channel (currently set to 1024). It returns a promise which resolves when itâ€™s safe to push more values.

`stop` is a both a promise and a function. As a function, `stop` can be called to stop a channel. Calling `stop` without any arguments stops the channel without error, and passing an error both stops the channel and causes the final iteration to reject with that error.

As a promise, `stop` can be awaited to defer event handler cleanup, and it can also be used with `Promise.race` to abort pending promises. If you pass a value to `Channel.prototype.return`, `stop` will resolve to that value.

The value of the final interation of the channel will be the return value of the executor. If the executor throws an error or returns a promise rejection, the channel will be immediately stopped and the final iteration will throw.

```ts
interface ChannelBuffer<T> {
  full: boolean;
  empty: boolean;
  add(value: T): void;
  remove(): T | undefined;
}

class FixedBuffer<T> implements ChannelBuffer<T> {
  constructor(capacity: number);
}

class SlidingBuffer<T> implements ChannelBuffer<T> {
  constructor(capacity: number);
}

class DroppingBuffer<T> implements ChannelBuffer<T> {
  constructor(capacity: number);
}
```

The `Channel` constructor optionally takes a `ChannelBuffer` instance as its second argument. Buffers allow multiple values to be pushed onto channels without waiting. `FixedBuffer` allows channels to push a set number of values, `DroppingBuffer` drops the *latest* values when the buffer has reached capacity, and `SlidingBuffer` drops the *earliest* values when the buffer has reached capacity. You can define custom buffering behaviors by implementing the `ChannelBuffer` interface.
